# haskell-fun-times
Just a repo of me learning and playing with haskell

## resources
- Haskell Programming from First Principles ([book](http://haskellbook.com/) and [notes](./from-first-principles))
- Learn You A Haskell For Great Good! ([book](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) and [notes](./learn-you-a-haskell))
- Typeclassopedia ([book](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia) and [notes](./typeclassopedia))
- CIS 194 ([online course](http://cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html) and [notes](./cis-194))

## future

#### courses
- Joachim Breitner's CIS 194 [online lectures & assignments](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/fall16/). At least weeks >= 11, which seem very focused on applied haskell.
- The [Monad Challenges](http://mightybyte.github.io/monad-challenges/) can't hurt

#### books
- Pearls of functional design by Richard Bird ([amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Pearls-Functional-Algorithm-Design-Richard/dp/0521513383) but pdf easily found online)
- [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/) is outdated, but probably still worth
- [Simple IO to Monad Transformers](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-IO-Monad-Transformers-ebook/dp/B00KN6XZ1M)
